classdef Sampler < TMSi.HiddenHandle
    %SAMPLER Class provides sampling capabilities for a single TMSi device.
    %
    %   The Sampler class encapsulates the functionality of sampling TMSi device. This
    %   can be either done in normal mode, or impedance mode. In case of impedance mode
    %   the sampling frequency is fixed and is not represented in the sample_rate value
    %   of the class.
    %
    %   The sample rate can be set to a maximum of device.base_sample_rate and a minimum
    %   of device.base_sample_rate / 2^device.sample_rate_setting. For example a TMSi device
    %   that runs at 2048 Hz, and has a sample_rate_setting of 4, can be set to sample at a
    %   minimum of 128 Hz. 
    %
    %   Reference calculation is turned on by default. Reference calculation removes common
    %   distortion on all channels from the signal. For example 50 Hz. 
    %
    %   When sampling with a Sampler, the device has to be connected through the sampler, and
    %   not through the device object. Reason for this is that the sample rate and buffer size
    %   can only be set after connection is established and is lost as soon as the device is
    %   disconnected.
    %
    %SAMPLER Properties:
    %   library - The TMSi library.
    %   device - The device that is used as source.

    %   sample_rate - The sample rate in Hz.

    %   reference_calculation - True, if reference calculation is done.
    %   overflow_value - The default value for when a channel is in overflow.
    %   impedance_mode - True, if device is going to sample in impedance_mode.
